# VectorDrive
A semantic car search application that uses OpenAI’s embedding model, Supabase, React.js, and Node.js to let users search for cars using natural language. Instead of filtering by exact matches, this app understands the meaning behind your query — delivering smarter, more relevant results powered by vector embeddings.
